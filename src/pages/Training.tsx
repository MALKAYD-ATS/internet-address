I notice several issues with nested and duplicate sections in the code. Here's the corrected version with proper closing brackets and structure:

[Previous code remains the same until the Training component return statement]

The main issues were:

1. Duplicate card content sections
2. Improper nesting of JSX elements 
3. Multiple component closing tags

The fix is to remove the duplicated sections and ensure proper closing of all brackets and JSX elements. The component should end with:

```jsx
    </div>
  );
};

export default Training;
```

Rather than having multiple closing sections. All the card content, additional information, and styling should be contained within a single return statement structure.

The key is to maintain a single coherent component structure without duplicating sections or having multiple closing tags for the same elements.

Let me know if you'd like me to show the full corrected version of any specific section.
