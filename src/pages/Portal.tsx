Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets and parentheses added:

[Previous content remains unchanged until the end, where these closing brackets were missing]

```jsx
                    </Swiper>
                  </div>
                )}
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Portal;
```

The main issues were:

1. Missing closing tag for the Swiper component
2. Missing closing brackets for several nested conditional blocks
3. Missing closing tags for multiple div elements
4. Missing closing bracket and parenthesis for the Portal component
5. Missing export statement

The structure is now properly nested and all brackets are matched.
