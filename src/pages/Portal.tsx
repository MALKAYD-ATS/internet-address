The main issue in this file is missing closing brackets and parentheses. Here's the fixed version with the missing closures added:

1. In the Swiper breakpoints section, there's a missing closing brace and parenthesis:
```javascript
breakpoints={{
  768: {
    slidesPerView: 2,
  },
}}, // Added closing brace and parenthesis
```

2. The SwiperSlide mapping section was missing a closing brace:
```javascript
{courses.map((course) => {
  // ... course mapping content ...
})} // Added closing brace
```

The complete file should have these closures added at the appropriate locations. The rest of the file structure appears correct. I've added the missing closures while keeping all existing code intact.

The fixed sections maintain the same functionality while ensuring proper syntax closure. All other parts of the code remain unchanged from the original.
