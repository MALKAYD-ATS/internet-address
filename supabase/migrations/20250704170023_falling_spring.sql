  # Create practice questions table

  1. New Tables
    - `practice_questions`
      - `id` (bigint, primary key)
      - `question` (text, required)
      - `option_a`, `option_b`, `option_c`, `option_d` (text, required)
      - `correct_answer` (text, A/B/C/D only)
      - `explanation` (text, required)
      - `image_url` (text, optional)
      - `course_id` (uuid, foreign key to courses_ats.id)
      - `created_at` (timestamptz, default now)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `practice_questions` table
    - Add policy for public read access to practice questions

  3. Sample Data
    - Insert practice questions for existing courses
    - Questions cover basic and advanced RPAS topics
